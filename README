Sketching a small WebGL scene graph library

Goals: [- planned, + implemented, x started]
  Put together quick presentation graphics
  Make simple things simple
    Loading and displaying simple textured models
      x Load archives with model and textures using XMLHttpRequest
      - Multiple lights
    Drawing text
      + Draw text using the 2D canvas
      + Billboard text (buggy)
      x Layouted text (this is an utter pain to implement though)
      - Extruded text (hmm?)
    Drawing images
      + Load image to textured quad
    Applying post-processing filters
      - Cameras with FBO render targets
      + Material system
    Animation
      x Animation vocabulary
      - Transformation tweens
      x Follow along Bezier curves & Catmull-Rom splines
    User inputs
      + Default camera navigation
      - Event handlers
    Drawing presentation geometry
      x Cubes, mesh cubes
      + Quads, mesh quads
      + Spheres
      - Capped cylinders
      x Ring segments, capped rings
      - Ribbons (along Bezier paths)
      - Dice
      + Fullscreen quads
      - Layouted arrays of objects (grids, circles, ...)
